RoStrap is a third-party replacement for the standard Roblox bootstrapper, providing additional useful features and improvements.

RoStrap is only supported for PCs running Windows.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this malware?**

**A:** No. The source code here is viewable to all, and it'd be impossible for us to slip anything malicious into the downloads without anyone noticing. Just be sure you're downloading it from an official source. The only official source are this GitHub repository. RoStrap is open-source, and all changes can be reviewed by the community. We encourage users to verify the code themselves before installing. Transparency is a core part of our project.

**Q: Can using this get me banned?**

**A:** No, it shouldn't. RoStrap doesn't interact with the Roblox client in the same way that exploits do.

## Installing

1. [Download the latest release of RoStrap](https://github.com/ASDFFounder2015/RoStrap/releases/latest) and run the installer.
2. Configure your preferences if needed, then complete the installation.
3. [Install the .NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win11-x64&apphost_version=6.0.16&gui=true) if you don’t already have it installed. If prompted, install it before continuing with RoStrap.
4. If Windows Smartscreen shows a popup when running RoStrap for the first time, click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"**. This happens because the program is new, not because it's detected as malicious.
5. Once installed, RoStrap will be added to your **Start Menu**, where you can access the menu and reconfigure your preferences if needed.
